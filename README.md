# CareerCodesMultiClassClassification

The major goal of this project is to divide each profession into the corresponding Holland occupation codes, which is a very useful tool that teachers used at school that helps
students identify the possible university programs and careers they can pursue based on their interests and strengths. The Holland codes are: (R: Realistic), (I: Investigative), 
(A: Artistic), (S: Social), (E: Entrepreneur), (C: Conventional).
